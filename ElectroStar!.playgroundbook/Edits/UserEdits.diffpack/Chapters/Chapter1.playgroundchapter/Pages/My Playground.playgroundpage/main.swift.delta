 E L E C T R O S T A R !
 ✨ Inspired by my little sister and physics class!
 🙏 Thank you for making this competition possible.
 
 
 
 To-do before running
 —————————————————————————————
 • It's preferable that the device is in landscape mode and the lock rotation turned on during the gameplay.
 • You may please set the playground in fullscreen (hiding the code) before running it for the best possible experience.
 
 
 
 Things to consider
 —————————————————————————————
 • All used images have either been made by me or exported from SFSymbols, with (when allowed) or without modifications.
 • I learned and used SpriteKit and CoreMotion, all for the first time, during the two weeks leading up to the deadline. I went the hard way and made everything programmatically. Although the implementations are not perfect, I'm very proud of myself and the personal achievements I've been able to make thanks to this competition!
 • Initializing SKSpriteNode by using image names instead of UIImage is more reliable. Hence, I created the ImageName struct to store the name of all visual assets.
 • When convenient, I prefixed custom SpriteKit subclasses with "SK" to signify the possibility to individually port them to any other project with little to no changes required.
